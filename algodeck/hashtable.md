# Hash Table

## Hash table complexity: search, insert, delete

All: amortized O(1), worst O(n)

[#complexity](complexity.md) [#hashtable](hashtable.md)

## Hash table implementation

- Array of linked list
- Hash code function to give the array index

Resize the array when a threshold is reached

If extreme nonuniform distribution, could be replaced by array of BST
