When you want to access Higher priority and lower priority element very
frequently then heaps is the best choice. It has O(1) complexity while fetching
lowest element (Min Heap) and Highest element (Max heaps).Below are the some of
the important points about heap.

- Heaps are not sorted.
- Nodes in heaps does not have specific relation with other nodes.
- Height of heaps (Heap is complete binary tree) O(log N).
- Searching other element in Heap takes O(N) because traversing is required.
